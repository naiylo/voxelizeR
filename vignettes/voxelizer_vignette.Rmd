# Introduction

## The voxelizeR Package

The `voxelizeR` package offers advanced functionalities for voxelizing LiDAR point cloud data. By implementing sophisticated ray-tracing algorithms, it enables the computation of critical metrics such as Leaf Area Density (LAD) and facilitates occlusion mapping within specified spatial boundaries. This package is a collaborative development between the "Deutsche GeoForschungsZentrum" and the "University of Potsdam".

This comprehensive guide aims to elucidate the primary features of the `voxelizeR` package and provide practical examples using the included sample datasets.

## Key Functionalities

The `voxelizeR` package includes the following key functionalities:

-   **Voxelization of LiDAR Point Clouds**: Efficiently converts LiDAR point cloud data into a voxel-based representation.
-   **Ray-Tracing Algorithms**: Implements advanced ray-tracing techniques to calculate metrics such as Leaf Area Density (LAD).
-   **Occlusion Mapping**: Performs occlusion mapping to analyze visibility and coverage within defined spatial boundaries.
-   **Integration with R**: Seamlessly integrates with the R programming environment, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of voxelized data.

# Installation

To install the development version of `voxelizeR` from GitHub, you can use the `devtools` package. Follow these steps:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
